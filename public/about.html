<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Hi! I’m Ishan Lodh, a first-year Computer Science and 
Engineering student with a growing passion for technology and problem-solving. I’m currently
exploring the world of Competitive Programming (CP)
and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to strengthen my logic and coding skills.</p>

<p>Alongside that, I’m also diving into Web Development, learning to build
interactive and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to 
become a well-rounded developer capable of creating impactful digital solutions.</p>

<p>I’m always eager to learn new technologies, take on challenges, and improve with 
every project I work on. This portfolio reflects my journey — from writing my first lines of
code to developing projects that bring ideas to life.</p>
